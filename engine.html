    <h1>How Engines Work</h1>
    <p>
        Engines are the heart of any vehicle. They convert fuel into mechanical energy, which powers the vehicle. 
        There are various types of engines, including internal combustion engines, electric motors, and hybrid engines. 
        Each type has its own unique working mechanism and advantages.
    </p>

    <h2>Four-Stroke Internal Combustion Engine</h2>
    <p>
        The four-stroke internal combustion engine is the most common type of engine used in automobiles. 
        It operates on the principle of converting the chemical energy of fuel into mechanical energy through a series of controlled explosions.
        The engine consists of several key components, including the cylinder, piston, crankshaft, camshaft, valves, and spark plug (in gasoline engines).
        The cylinder is where the combustion process occurs, and the piston moves up and down within the cylinder to create power.
        The crankshaft converts the linear motion of the piston into rotational motion, which ultimately drives the wheels of the vehicle.
        The camshaft controls the opening and closing of the valves, allowing the air-fuel mixture to enter the cylinder and the exhaust gases to exit.
        The spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture in gasoline engines, while diesel engines rely on the heat of compression to ignite the fuel.
        The four-stroke cycle consists of four distinct strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust.
    </p>

    <p>
        The four-stroke cycle is a continuous process, with each stroke occurring in sequence. 
        The engine's efficiency and power output depend on various factors, including the design of the engine, the type of fuel used, and the operating conditions.
        Understanding how engines work is essential for anyone interested in automobiles, as it provides insight into the technology that powers our vehicles.
        Whether you're a car enthusiast, a mechanic, or simply curious about how things work, learning about engines can deepen your appreciation for the engineering marvels that drive our world.
    </p>
    <p>
        A four-stroke internal combustion engine works by completing four distinct strokes (or cycles) of the piston within the cylinder. 
        These strokes are intake, compression, power, and exhaust. Here's a detailed explanation of each stroke:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Intake Stroke</h3>
    <p>
        The intake stroke begins when the piston moves downward from the top of the cylinder (Top Dead Center or TDC) to the bottom (Bottom Dead Center or BDC). 
        During this stroke, the intake valve opens, allowing the air-fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. The downward motion of the piston creates a vacuum, 
        pulling the mixture into the combustion chamber.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Compression Stroke</h3>
    <p>
        In the compression stroke, the piston moves upward from BDC to TDC. Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed, sealing the cylinder. 
        The air-fuel mixture is compressed into a smaller space, increasing its pressure and temperature. This compression makes the mixture highly combustible, 
        preparing it for ignition.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Power Stroke</h3>
    <p>
        The power stroke is where the engine generates power. At TDC, the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in gasoline engines) 
        or by the heat of compression (in diesel engines). The explosion forces the piston downward with great force, converting chemical energy into mechanical energy. 
        This is the only stroke that produces power to drive the engine.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Exhaust Stroke</h3>
    <p>
        The exhaust stroke expels the burnt gases from the cylinder. The piston moves upward from BDC to TDC, and the exhaust valve opens. 
        The upward motion of the piston pushes the exhaust gases out through the exhaust valve and into the exhaust system, preparing the cylinder for the next cycle.
